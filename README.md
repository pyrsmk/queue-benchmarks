# Queue algorithms benchmark

These benchmarks have been made to write this [blog post](https://dev.to/pyrsmk/i-benchmarked-several-queue-algorithms-4hp6). Refer to it if you need some explanations.

This tiny project is using [Run](https://github.com/pyrsmk/run) to handle its task. But you can easily copy/paste the commands from `Runfile.rb` if you don't want yo use it.

To run the benchmarks:

```
run bench
```
